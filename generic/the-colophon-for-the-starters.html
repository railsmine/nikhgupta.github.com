<p>So, here I am.. back and revived.. with all you people starin&#8217; at the new me..<br />yeah..!! master has given me some new skin.. some new soul and some new toys..<br />and, I know you are, definitely, wonderin&#8217; at how stylish I can be with so much elegance at my disposal, but I am only being modest..<br />you don&#8217;t even know, the major half of the story.. the shear power..<br /><em>go on.. read on.. how I was born? about my advent, my dogfood and me..</em><br /><strong>and most specially, if you are interested in developin&#8217; my soulmate ;)</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Hey everyone..</em><br />I am Nikhil Gupta, a web developer, and a tech explorer, by which I am only trying to emphasis on the fact that anything remotely linked with technology has all my interest in it - be it linux administration, new gadgets, web development or simply, blogging - infact, you can simply throw any tech-junkie (materialistic, or non-materialistic), and I will savour it, like I was waiting for it to come to me..</p>

<h2 id='the_prologue'>The Prologue</h2>

<p>I started blogging around 2005 with WordPress.com pages, and soon, moved to self-hosted WordPress for the control it provided me on my blog. I enjoyed everything WordPress provided me, but then it was too much of a pain to login to a site, write inside some WYSIWYG editor, losing important content due to some server migration or hardware-failure or anything-else-equally-evil-not-in-my-mind-right-now. And, how can I deny the fact that WordPress was, just, too easy. Where am I to show that I am a developer, who loves coding, where is the damn innovation?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the blogging scenario has always been in a hiatus for me, for lack of my interest in &#8216;simply&#8217; blogging. I, even, developed a <a href='/projects/wordpress-cli-poster/' title='WordPress CLI Poster'>WordPress CLI Poster</a> for my personal use <em>(it is unfinished, but does the work on Ubuntu based distros)</em>. After a really long period of time, when I was, again, searching for something more developer-friendly, I came across this article: <a href='http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html'>blogging like a hacker</a> by <a href='http://tom.preston-werner.com/'>Tom Preston Werner</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>That was it..</strong> That was, exactly, what I was searching for. And, it was there for so long, yet I never paid attention. It was based on Ruby, which is why I, probably, never got to it, before. But, as they say, <em>You are never late for anything!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id='the_advent'>The Advent</h2>

<p>So, I started understanding what <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki'>Jekyll</a> really is - how it can help, what plugins were available, how much I could extend the core, and things similar. And, Jekyll, simply, is amazing. Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website. Some of the features I, now <em>(I have made the WordPress =&gt; Jekyll shift)</em>, enjoy are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A static HTML website - which means responsiveness, and much better load times.</li>

<li>An editor of my choice (gedit on Ubuntu platform, notepad++ on Windows) for writing my content - analogous to writing my code.</li>

<li>Git revision control for my website and its content, powered by <a href='http://github.com'>Github</a> - oh! and, please do not ask me what that means - fare enough to say: <em>it is a must for, literally, anything I do, if applicable even remotely.</em></li>

<li>No complicated blogging engines to maintain, update, or spend more than half of my time customizing it to my taste (everytime)</li>

<li>Stylize contents the way, I prefer without the hassle of maintaining something which has no connection with what I am writing (nodes? custom post-types?). I do not write awesome posts. I only write my thoughts in a simple narrative way. I only post some code snippets, some photographs, and probably thats it. I do not need a full-blown CMS.</li>

<li>Availability of rake tasks, command line, crons, etc. for simple maintenace, configurations, and hence, following the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&apos;t_repeat_yourself'>DRY</a> principle while blogging :)</li>

<li>Easy deployment, new posts, upgrades, etc. with a single line on my console.</li>

<li>Use of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&apos;t_repeat_yourself'>MarkDown</a> for writing posts where the source looks and feels like normal content :) which relieves me from the pain of clicking buttons to make my text bold, italic or a hyperlink.</li>

<li>Syntax highlighting inbuilt.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='photography'>Photography?</h2>

<p>Alright, so as I mentioned, I only write simple posts, code snippets and post some photographs. <em>Ouch!</em> Photographs? Yeah, that would make my git repository, just, too heavy! We have automatic syntaxt highlighting <em>(with pygments)</em> and hence, that is taken care of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, photographs?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hmm.. I do not want to get too heavy. I am really enjoying the agility, I have, master!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flickr?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah. There is <a href='https://github.com/pelosi/marran.com/blob/master/_plugins/flickr.rb'>this really nice plugin</a>, that can import <a href='http://www.flickr.com/'>Flickr</a> photosets for me!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, nice.. But, I need something more flexible. I might, at times, want to show off some photosets - other times, simply some photos or maybe some custom search might be required one day, as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hmm.. You can code it for me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh! yes. definitely. But, it is ruby.. :(</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>at least, you can try!!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh! hell, yes.. lets, do it..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is how things went :) And, I am quite satisfied with the end-result. <strong>I, now, have an <a href='https://github.com/nikhgupta/nikhgupta.com/blob/master/plugins/flickr.rb'>Advanced Flickr Jekyll plugin</a> that does almost all the functionality, I could have wanted (or anyone else). It allows me to post photos, photosets, galleries, custom searches, with optional exif data and most importantly, cached content without making my website repository, any larger in size. The plugin is available at <a href='https://github.com/nikhgupta/nikhgupta.com/blob/master/plugins/flickr.rb'>Github</a></strong></p>

<h2 id='whats_more'>Whats more?</h2>

<p>hmm.. I have various <a href='https://github.com/nikhgupta/nikhgupta.com/blob/master/Rakefile'>rake tasks</a> defined, which help me developing on my Jekyll site, locally - help me publish this website with a single command, re-build the entire site, commit to Github, create new posts, push some tags and what not.<br /><strong>I, even, went overboard and re-arranged the default folder structure of Jekyll to a custom one, which is then again converted to a Jekyll-aware folder structure via rake tasks. This allows me to define various themes for my sites (a theme, thus defined, helps me configure which skin would be shown or use a particular language for my layouts, and even which plugins will be used, etc.) - which in turn, helps me to customize my Jekyll site to even greater extent, e.g. defining site-wide and theme-based plugins. Moreover, the folder structure looks softer on my eyes. For more details, have a look at this <a href='https://github.com/nikhgupta/nikhgupta.com'>Github</a> repository.</strong></p>

<h2 id='and_the_epilogue'>And, the epilogue..</h2>

<p>To be honest, I have no idea what to write, in the epilogue. But, as is my custom, I do add a &#8216;prologue&#8217; and an &#8216;epilogue&#8217; for each of my posts. I would be working on the Jekyll site, here at <a href='http://www.nikhgupta.com/' title='Nikhil Gupta'>www.nikhgupta.com</a> for a major part of this month, and some cool goodies are in development. I will write more on Jekyll and its awesome superiority, but enough for now!<br /><strong>Adieus!</strong></p>
